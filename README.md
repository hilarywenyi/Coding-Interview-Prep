# Coding-Interview-Prep :+1:

## What is it?
This is a to-do list of topics in computer science, especially in data structure and algorithms that I wanted to comb through.

## Who am I ?
Bio-chemical Engineer/Software Developer. An active member in Grace Hopper Academy.

## Who you are?
Either you are new to software engineering, or you have some web development background and want to level up your coding skills. This is a good place to start.
